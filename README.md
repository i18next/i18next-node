# Introduction

[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/jamuhl/i18next-node.png)](http://travis-ci.org/jamuhl/i18next-node)

Project goal is to provide the same easy way to translate a website on serverside like in 
[i18next](https://github.com/jamuhl/i18next) on the clientside:

- Translation inside your server code or template
- loading resourcefiles
- update resourcefiles with missing strings
- interpolation, plurals, nesting or resources
- serve the same resources to the clientside

# installation

	npm install i18next

# usage

First require the module and init i18next:

	var i18next = require('i18next');
	i18next.init(); // for options see i18next-node gh-page

Register the express middleware, so we can check current language settings:

	// Configuration
	app.configure(function() {
	    app.use(express.bodyParser());
	    app.use(i18next.handle);
	    app.use(app.router);

	    [...]
	});

Register AppHelper so you can use the translate function in your template:

	i18next.registerAppHelper(app)

Now you can (depending on your template language) do something like this in you template:

	// sample in jade
	body
        span= t('app.name')

To serve the clientside script and needed routes for resources and missing keys:

	i18next.serveClientScript(app)
	    .serveDynamicResources(app)
	    .serveMissingKeyRoute(app);

now you can add the script to you page and use i18next on the client like on the server:

	script(src='i18next/i18next.js', type='text/javascript')

    $.i18n.init([options], function() { 
        $('#appname').text($.t('app.name'));
    });

for more information on clientside usage have a look at [i18next](http://jamuhl.github.com/i18next/)
